<b>React Weather App</b> <br/><br/>
<b>Description: </b><br/>In this project, I have built an app that will forecast weather for cities which you will send it via api and retrieve corresponding data. I will send this data to the API via an API key(axios https://openweathermap.org/api). The API will send us a JSON from which we will extract the required data that is the temperature and city of the location.<br/><br/>
<b>Time Taken:</b> 1 days
